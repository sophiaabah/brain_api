// readFile is asycnronous. it uses a callback function which says run the result after reading /parsing the file and clearing the callstack (single-threaded)
// readFileSync reads / parses the file and returns the specified result directly afterward or synchronously

//More commands:
//fs.appendFile
//fs.write
//fs.unlink
